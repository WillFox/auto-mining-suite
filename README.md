# auto-mining-suite
An automated machine learning analysis suite.

Dependencies:
sklearn (sci kit learn machine learning library)
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
opencv (optional)

Goal: Build a data mining suite, where a function can be passed in that formats/reads the data in way for the automated scripts to read and therefore mine everything given a set of file patterns or list of files. 

This is meant to be a one off script that takes a long time to process.
